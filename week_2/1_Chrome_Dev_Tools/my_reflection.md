* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The DOM is the glue that brings the webpage together.  It is the common language used to bridge your HTML/XML and your JavaScript creating a functional design.  

My understanding is that during the birth of JavaScript it was decided that a common language must be established to move forward with design.  DOM and JavaScript were both performing similar functions at the time.  JavaScript was set down the path of application design while DOM was left to handle the bits and pieces hooking site items together.

I looked at a couple of sites that were created from Wordpress, but I really couldn't find the difference.  To be honest, I wasn't entirely sure the site was created from Wordpress.  I intend to reach out to my group to ask after what they discovered here.  One thing that did stand out was the amount of action happening in general in the elements tab.  So much code!

I am impressed by the amount of control I have over a site simply using the Web Tools provided in Chrome.  Everything that I have been exposed to within the toolset has been very easy to understand.  Its funny to think that I'm likely only looking at a small percentage of what the tools are truly capable of.
