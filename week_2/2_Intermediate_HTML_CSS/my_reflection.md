# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

We live in a dynamic world filled with people from every corner eager to design the web as they see fit.  With so many "fingers in the pie" standards must be implemented in order to establish order from chaos.  They are, much like many other things, not inheriently good or bad, but the goal in which they serve is both welcome and required.

After learning about the new HTML5 elements (header, footer, article, etc) and incorporating them into my code I can already see an advantage to my readability.  Anything that increase the style of my code and make bug finding easier, I'm fully on board with.  

Applying the code contained within "reset.css" allows for older versions of web browsers to properly integrate the new HMTL5 commands.  Certain elements (p, ul, etc) contain default styling that can alter your layout in unexpected ways.

I have Chrome, IE, and Firefox installed on my machine.  Yes...  I have noticed that different browsers will render sites differently.  Annoying.  What catches my eye most is the text rendering.  Its completely different between IE and Chrome and it throws me off.  

In addition to the provided reading I also hit up Mozilla's Dev section.
