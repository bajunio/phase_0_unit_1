# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design is the practice of creating dynamically laid out frameworks as a basis for a site that will display well on a variety of media types.  How could you dislike that?  I've always wondered about the "m.example.com" sites that were tailored for mobile devices.  I figured there was a need for a seperate site, but knowing now the work that would go into maintaining muliple versions of your site to support endless variants of displays makes me ill.  Starting with responsive design framework can allow your default layout to render on many displays.  

Any time that we introduce new technology to the general enviornment, we will see changes in our practices.  For instance, with the introduction of smart phones we had to not only tailor our sites for the array of current desktop browsers, but also to accomodate the smaller, more limited browsers of the smart phones.  We are pushing towards more and more mobility with our devices.  It won't be long until we are designing for HUDs and all of these current methods will be old news.

I'd say the biggest thing that's stuck in my mind is to be mindful of my layout.  Its an em world out there and my px isn't cutting it.
