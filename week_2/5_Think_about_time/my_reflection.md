# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

Tangents will be the death of me.  I keep adjusting my game plan and I still feel as though I keep getting lost down the rabbit hole.  There are endless readings on every topic we are learning.  I am having trouble determining when I have learned enough to move on and when I adiving a bit too far into my studies at this point of my training.  

Sometimes the design phase of my project will have me reeling for hours.  Which font?  How should I display the data in such a way that he user is going to navigate my page like a pro from the moment of landing upon it?  I'll admit that I have not been dilligently creating wireframes and I'm sure that if I would start taking them more seriously it would drastically cut down on my design time. 

My plan for next week will be to skim the entire week's content (shy of the "do not look here" sections) and create a check list.  I feel that if I were to quantify the required work into a readable list, it will help me maintain focus on my immediate goals.  I have no idea why this hadn't occured to me earlier as I have been using a list at the very end of the week to gauge my projects for completeness.   

I plan to focus on the material.  I plan to not allow myself to feel defeated.  I will plan to reduse my levels of anxiety.  I plan to reach out when I need help.  

I need to keep on track and realize that I cannot be perfect right out of the gate.  Everyone started somewhere and this is where I will begin.
