# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: https://bajunio.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


Site design and user experience feel seperate but the same.  They must work in tandem to achieve the most efficient site possible.  

I enjoy brain storming ideas for my potential work.  Sometimes a bit too much, I'm afraid.  I really need to focus on finding a planning strategy that will work for me.  I spin my wheels forever looking up more information on concepts or worry over insignificant things like finding the perfect image.  I'd like to get to a point where I can get my framework down cold and then "pretty" it up.  

I learned a bit more about HTML5 and am starting to feel a bit more comfortable with the newly introduced elements.  I'd like to continue pushing this understanding by using them more freely in future design.  Of course, I'd like to introduce JavaScript goodness to my page.  Once I get a good grip in the upcoming weeks I'll be able to tie in neat effects!

The content all seemed to make sense, on paper.  Incorporating the new syntax into my existing routines seemed to go really well.  Instead of going with something like <div id="header"> I was able to simply mark it as <header>.  Of course there were some hiccups and I still have some questions in regard to applying classes and ids to these new elements via CSS.  I would assume they will continue to respond to multiples of both classes and ids. (They do.)
