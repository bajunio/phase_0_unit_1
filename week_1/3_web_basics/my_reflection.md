Its amazing to discover exactly how much you take for granted in your day to day life when it comes to the advances that have been made in technology.  It was interesting to learn about the reasons behind the latency when registering or changing an existing domain.  The sheer amount of addresses that DNS servers have to process is staggering.  The devised system handles the task quite well by distributing the load across multiple connections around the globe.  This also carries the benefit of redundancy.  

I learned a new term during this lesson, "WYSIWYG" (what you see if what you get).  It describes a process of using editors to reproduce website framing.  They do their best to interperet your intentions, but, seemingly, often make overly verbose code or blantant errors.  The result is messy and confusing code to work with in the future.  Its best to nail down the fundamentals for yourself so that you can circumvent putting yourself in dangerous coding waters.  

I was was nervous that my site was not going to load properly due to some sort of error in my process.  GitHub's default error page warns of a delay that can be upwards of 10 minutes before loading freshly submitted content.  It was time for me to catch BART for home so I closed up shop and caught my train.  It wasn't until I got home and refreshed my browser that I frist saw, "Hello DBC!"

When the guide was prompting for my feelings on seeing the content online, I admit, I didn't think my reaction would have been overly excited.  I'm glad to report my experience was quite the opposite.  I felt very accomplished to have not only published content to the web, but to have done so by using my local installation of GitHub's app.  It was at this time I really felt my understanding of the git process solidify.  

Laying the proper foundation when considering your website's setup is important.  This includes who you will be acquiring your domain name from and who will be doing your hosting.  A general rule of thumb for costs; registration should be no more than $15/year and hosting no more than $50/year.  

Before we get to wrapped up in where our site will live, we should first consider what the goal of our site will be.  Who will be our audience?  What content are we looking to offer and what tools will we need to ensure that happens?  Sitting down and doing a quick overview of your project before you dive in can go a long way to keeping you focused on the end results.
