## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?


...here we go!

What is git and why do you need it in your life?  


Imagine you have been tasked with building a 75 piece puzzle.  You setup your table, lay out the pieces, and get to building.  Upon completing your work you submit your masterpiece to whoever commissioned it for approval.  Everything checks out and you're on to your next task.

You must now construct a 750,000 piece puzzle.  The project is such an undertaking that you've been assigned five additional staff members to assist in this build.  Attempting to replicate your last actions you setup your table but quickly realize that space is at a premium and your team is mostly standing in each other's way.  

The need to design a work area that can comfortably accommodate six people is now the problem.  One way to solve this is by increasing the size of the table.  Everyone now has a bit of elbow room but unfortunately your team keeps grabbing for the same pieces at the same time.  We still have efficiency issues to address.  

Working through the situation, it becomes obvious to you that you'll have to split up the pieces and workload, but how?  You have no idea which pieces belong in which section so each team member must have access to every piece.  A clever way to accomplish this is by obtaining six copies of the puzzle and distributing one to each of your team.  Each member can now build their own table, lay out the pieces, and focus on their section of the puzzle without distraction from ten other hands reaching and grabbing.  

Since you were the original puzzle builder, your puzzle has been designated the main or master puzzle amongst your team.  As members of your team complete their assigned sections, they bring them to you for approval.  You have the authority to accept their work and add it to your own or deny their changes and provide feedback as to how they could improve their submissions.  

Having all of these sections fall into place perfectly is challenging and mistakes can be made.  To assist in recovering from any mistakes, you have elected to take pictures with your smartphone.  Every time either you or any of your team makes changes, the pictures are saved containing detailed information on exactly what changed and by whom.  

Letâ€™s bring all of this together.  You now have an efficient and scalable puzzle building team that is capable of simultaneously contributing to a single project.  This is all while maintaining perfect control on what makes it to the final product and accurate documentation of every change and decision made along the way.  

This is git.  The puzzle is your application, the team members are your developers, and the sections are chunks of code.

Git is not to be confused with GitHub.  If you were to break down GitHub to "git" and "hub" it makes more sense, at least to me.  GitHub is a hub or meeting point to facilitate the git processes.  The beauty of GitHub is the ability to collaborate on projects in a very social manor with team members spanning the globe.  Of course the main feature of git is to provide version control for said projects.  

I feel I have a fairly good grip on the merits of git and the chaos it helps to prevent.  From having a single workspace to manage multiple contributors to a detailed history of every change made at your fingertips, git has firmly established itself as an invaluable tool.  

My GitHub account creation and initial installation of the GitHub application went very smoothly.  It was not until I ran through the Phase 0 git tutorial that I submitted my first commit.  The process of committing this document has granted me practical experience and has driven home the concept of version control.

I look forward to becoming more familiar with the command line syntax when interfacing with GitHub in the future.


This was a bit long winded, but I had already typed the first couple of paragraphs - it was too late to give up.
