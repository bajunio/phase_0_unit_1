## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

...here we go!


Imagine you have been tasked with building a 75 piece puzzle.  You setup your table, lay out the pieces, and get to building.  Upon completing your work you submit your masterpiece to whomever commissioned it for approval.  Everything checks out and you're on to your next task.

You must now construct a 750,000 piece puzzle.  The project is such an undertaking that you've been assigned five additional staff members to assist in this build.  Attempting to replicate your last actions you setup your table but quickly realize that space is at a premium and your team is mostly standing in each other's way.  

The need to design a work area that can comfortably accomodate six people is now your problem.  This can be solved by increasing the size of the table.  Everyone now has a bit of elbow room but unfortunately your team keeps grabbing for the same pieces at the same time.  We still have effiency issues to address.  

Working through the situation, it becomes obvious to you that you'll have to split up the pieces and workload, but how?  You have no idea which pieces belong in which section so each team member must have access to every piece.  A clever way to accomplish this is by obtaining six copies of the puzzle and distributing one to each of your team.  Each member can now build their own table, lay out the pieces, and focus on their section of the puzzle without distraction from ten other hands reaching and grabbing.  

Since you were the original puzzle builder, your puzzle has been designated the main or master puzzle amongst your team.  As members of your team complete their assigned sections, they bring them to you for approval.  You have the authority to accept their work and add it to your own or deny their changes and provide feedback as to how they could improve their submissions.  

Getting all of these sections to fit together perfectly is challenging and mistakes can be made.  To assist in recovering from any mistakes, you have elected to take pictures with your smartphone everytime either you or any of your team make changes.  The pictures are saved with the changes made and the person who made these changes tied to them.  

Lets bring all of this together.  You now have an efficient and scalable puzzle building team that is capable of simultaneously contributing to a single project.  This is all while maintaining perfect control on what makes it to the final product and accuate documentation of every change and decision made along the way.  This is git.  



This was a bit long winded, but I had already typed the first couple of paragraphs out - it was too late to give up.
