## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


In order to create a respository ("repo") on GitHub, you'll first need to establish an account by visiting their main site, https://github.com.  Then, you'll need to download and install the GitHub application located here; Mac - https://mac.github.com, and for PC - https://windows.github.com.  

Now that you have your account and application setup, its time to create a repo!  Access your GitHub account via your web browser and locate the "New respository" button in the lower, right hand corner.  Click the link to begin the creation of your repo.

You'll have a few options to run through to properly setup your repo.  They consist of it's name, description, public/private status, and license association.  Once you have made your selections, click "Create respository."  Please read below for an additional breakdown of each section.  

Repository name:
The name can be whatever you'd like your project to be called.  Though this does allow for some creative flexibility, I prefer to keep the name of my project on point with it's purpose.  

Description (optional):
The description field is optional as stated on the site, but if you have elected to name your repo after your favorite cat, it may be a good idea to provide some additional information here as to avoid confusion.  Now we come to the selection of private or public.  

Public / Private status:
This flag opperates very much as you would suspect it to opperate.  Do you wish to keep the contents of this project to yourself or would you like to share your work with the world?  Unless you upgrade your GitHub account, you'll be forced to select "Public."  

License association:
You'll want to select "Initialize this repository with a README" and tag more options below.  By adding a ".gitignore" file to your directory, you can specifiy particular files to be ignored when peforming commits.  

The license selection process can be a bit more tricky.  When you select the dropdown, multiple options will appear.  Each of these options serves a very particular purpose and your selection must match your project.  They range from protecting you financially to ensuring your code's integrity.  Every project is different, therefore, for every project you create you must have a proper license be determined and implemented.  

For more help in picking which license if for you, please refer to the following resource: http://choosealicense.com.

Please note:  If you run into any difficulty while working from the local application, please refer to the installation links listed above for additional assistance.  I will be discussing the Windows version below.

Once you have finalized your intital setup of your repo from GitHub.com, you'll want to access the locally installed GitHub application.  You will need to login where asked and then establish an SSH key association with the device you are working from.  An SSH key is a unique identifier that will establish trust when submitting content from your local installation.  

Now you'll want to locate, in the upper, left hand corner the name of your GitHub account.  There should be two options, "Local" and "GitHub" - select "GitHub".  Your freshly created repo should now be listed here.  Please locate the press the clone button associated with the repo you are looking to pull down locally.  

I really like the idea of Open Source projects.  In an enviornment that is so focused on problem solving and efficiency, having teams of people submit countless solutions via Open Source work can only be a benefit to the average developer.  When reflecting upon the ideals that stem from this style of distribution, I find that I feel very well connected to the larger scene in general.  

Let's all change the world together!
