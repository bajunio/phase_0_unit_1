Good show, Justin!


Hello all!  I believe I've made introductions to at least two of you folks.  For those who I have not had a chance to chat with, I'm Brian!  I'm currently setup in San Leandro and work fulltime in The City for a Tech Ed software company.  I love to shoot pool, so, rack em' up!


Here are my sites for the exercise:

My learning style seems to be abstract/abstract.  I learn very well in groups when we are all struggling towards the same goal.  I'm also at ease researching endless on the web for solutions.


I'm still working towards completing some of the assignments, so some of these links may not be ready.

2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 


I'll admit that discovering others were also feeling the level of anxiety and excitement that I'm feeling was comforting.  I told myself that there would be students at all levels of skill and not to be discourged if I need additional time working through a problem.  One thing I'd love to know is how much time everyone has spent on this week's study.  I have invested upwards of 25 hours and I'm still feeling a pinch here on Sunday.  So, frantic is a feeling I'm having right now.  

I will be evaluating my available time next week.  It would be to my benefit to schedule some pairing sessions as that was so helpful this Saturday past.
