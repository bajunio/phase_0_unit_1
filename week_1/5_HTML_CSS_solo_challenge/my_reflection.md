Why won't my sidebar line up nicely next to my content area?  Did they date the same person in college or something?  Turns out to have just been a big misunderstanding - no bad blood, just bad coding.  I had ran into a road block right out of the gate when I failed to create a container div to house all of my other divs.  Once I established my container it was far easier to place my other divs within in.  

I'd say the most difficult concept to apply was the positioning in general.  To assist me with overcoming my difficulty with positioning, I connected with one of my accountabilibuddies.  He was interested in working on positioning in CSS and I was eager to have a sounding board.  I was clear with him in the beginning as to the particulars of my inquiry being rooted in my solo challenge and as a result were not for open discussion.  We decided on creating a small, 2x2 grid using five divs container, box1, 2, 3, 4) and positioning them with CSS.  This would allow me to further my understanding of positioning without compromising my solo challenge.

It was my first pairing session and it was incredible!  Thank you, Justin!  I was so amazed by how much insight I was able to gain on my problem just by discussing the basics with someone else who was striving for the same goal.  There is no question in my mind as to why more and more Engineering teams are moving towards the pairing model.  We took turns driving and navigating almostly seemlessly and the two hours we spent together seemed to fly by.  

During this solo challenge I feel that I really tighened my understanding of the relationship between HTML and CSS.  I suspect this feeling will remain a familiar one for the foreseeable future.  Although I was able to accomplish what I had wanted to visually, it feels like I may have used bad code to get there.  My pending review will be anticipated greatly.  

The best part of this assignment was dreaming up the concept.  It was important to me to have a touch of creativity in the project because this was my first solid attempt at building a webpage.  The results are pleasing.
