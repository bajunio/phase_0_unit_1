Once I realized that HTML is primarily responsible for providing content leaving CSS to do the heavy lifting when formatting, I felt like a big light bulb had been illuminated.  This allowed me to more clearly think about the design, code-wise, of my website.  Initially I assumed that HTML and CSS would have a much larger role in the actions contained on a website.  Of course they are ulitmately responsible for what goes where, but most of the advanced processes are left to languages like JavaScript.

HTML and CSS are, simply, really snazzy text editors like MS Word, but for the web.  They are simply tools and aren't exactly good or bad by themselves.  It seems to me that where they lack the ability to create, the offer compatibiity with tools that are capable of accomplishing the task.  Perhaps the bad could be expressed by observing the massive nesting that goes into HTML design.  So many close tags to forget!
